    "## Introduction\n",
    "Natural and anthropogenic sources emit a large number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These compounds greatly affect the “self-cleaning capacity” of the atmosphere. These compounds can also undergo complicated chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, forming organic aerosols. Organic aerosols have significant direct (absorbing/scattering) and indirect (affect cloud formation/properties) radiation effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand the broad impacts of VOCs on air quality and climate, we need to understand their sources and fates in the atmosphere. Many of these compounds can be directly emitted, or be produced from other compounds; in the meantime, they can undergo a variety of chemical reactions in the atmosphere. The chemical mechanism of these VOCs in the atmosphere can be very highly complicated, especially involving the formation of organic aerosols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most air quality models or chemistry-climate models are equipped with chemical mechanisms consisting of hundreds-thousands of chemical reactions. It is often found that such simplified chemical mechanisms are incapable to describe the complicity in the atmosphere. A widely used “near-explicit” chemical mechanism (Master Chemical Mechanism) consists of tens of thousands of chemical reactions, which still cannot capture the behavior and characteristics of the formation of organic aerosols. Such “near-explicit” mechanism is too computationally demanding for most air quality models or chemistry-climate models already.\n",
    "\n",
    "NCAR (USA) and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France) jointly developed a hyper-explicit chemical mechanism: Generator of Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A). GECKO-A can generate chemical mechanisms based on how the molecules/bonds/atoms interact with each other. Chemical mechanisms generated by GECKO-A usually include millions to tens of millions of reactions. Due to the remarkable computational cost, no air quality models or chemistry-climate models can afford to run with GECKO-A in the foreseeable future. There is a growing interest in the community to implement such complicated mechanisms into air quality models or chemistry-climate models, to study the broader impacts on air quality, human health, and the climate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine‐learning and artificial intelligence have proven to be a valuable tool in atmospheric science. Recent years have seen quite a few inspiring applications in developing machine-learning emulators using explicit/process-level models and implementing the trained emulators into large-scale models. Such explicit/process-level models are otherwise too expensive for large-scale models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to train the machine-learning emulator using the “library” generated by the hyper-explicit chemical mechanism, GECKO-A. \n"
